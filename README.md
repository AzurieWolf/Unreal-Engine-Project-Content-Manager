# Unreal-Engine-Project-Content-Manager
This program allows you to manage your project content folders for your Hogwarts Legacy UE project.

I made this program to make it easier for mod authors to switch between their projects while only having 1 project setup.

How it works:

You will have to set the directory of your projects content folder. after that it will ask you to enter a project name if you haven't used UEPCM before.

You can easily manage multiple content folders for a single project.

you just have to activate your project in the project manager tab and after that start your phoenix.uproject

If you'd like to create a new project and switch to it, just go to the create a new project tab and create a new project.
After entering a name and creating your new project, go to the project manager and set your new project to be the active project.
Don't worry about your project that was already in the content folder, it will be automatically moved into the UEPCM storage folder.
You can freely switch back and forth.

I recommend closing your unreal engine editor before switching your active project. then launching it again after switching.

<==== Setting your UE Project Content Directory ====>

To get started using UEPCM go to Settings > Set Directories > Set UE Project Content Folder Directory.

(Your "UE Project Content Folder" is the folder called "Content", located inside of your "PhoenixUProj" folder)


<==== Setting your UEPCM Content Projects Storage Directory ====>

You can also change the location of where UEPCM stores your Content Projects.

(By default, UEPCM stores your content projects in the root folder of the program, located inside of the folder called "UEPCM_Content_Projects_Storage")
