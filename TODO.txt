• Use the Projects.json to know what project is the active one so that you can have a temp folder for it in the content projects folder

• When setting the project content path, create a UEPCM_Data file in the directory of the project content folder
  if none exists, also create an empty folder with the name of the project like (Project_Name) and also ask for the name of the project.
  (Possibly move the UEPCM_Data file into that folder and add back the .json extension to it)

• Set the folder named (Project_Name) to be the name of the project when creating a new project.

• Add the ability to set the phoenix.uproject so you can launch the project within the program.
